# Example Code
Work from various classes at Columbus State Community College, uploaded as example code

## C Sharp Programming I

A First Level (but not introductory) course to C Sharp. Class expects an understanding of basic programing concepts (variables, loops, methods, and other generic programing concepts)

### Burger Picker

This Windows Form app was to show understanding of using Groups, Radio Buttons, and Checkboxes.

This app simulates a 'Self Ordering' console at a fast food resturant. Allows the user to pick from various condiments and extras, patties, and other options. Prints out a sample reciept.

### Code Breaker

This windows form app takes a phrase you want to encode, and a key phrase, and generates a very basic (not true) Play Fair array to generate an encypted line. It can also show the play fair array on command

### Flashcards

This is a simple flashcard app, randomizing 5 images and matching the answers. Uses a Fisher Yates shuffle.

### Mortgage Calculator

A basic calculator using windows forms. Second pass of this project added basic custom exceptions.


## Java Programing I

A First Level java programing course. Assumes only basic understanding of programing concepts, but pushes more into depth as time goes on.

It is important to note that most of the labs were provided with either some starting code, or strict parameters on what methods to use and how to call them, what they should return. Most of these are far more broken out than my typcial approach, but one must adhere to the parameters of the project, unless there is ample reason to do otherwise (and in class, there is little reason not to).

* Each lab has a corresponding Doc file, that has the parameters and restrictions of the lab, as well as example outputs


## Lab 1
 * A - Console: Making use of Scanner for input 
 * B - Console: Generic Splash Screen
 
## Lab 2
 * A - Console: Example shipping calculator
 * B - Console: Option based currency convertor


## Lab 3
 * A - Console: Basic payroll calculator
 * B - Console: Small 3 instancte character bubble sort.

## Lab 4
 * A - Console: Loops, keeps track of the number of positive, negative, and zero's entered.
 * B - Console: Find Highest (slight error here. An initial negative number can cause an issue)

## Lab 5

* A - Applet, energy calculator
* B - Applet, using Swing.

## Lab 6 
* A - Console: making use of Methods
* B - Applet, using swing: make use of methods. (This lab was given to us as a skeleton, we only had to do the methods)

## Lab 7
* A - Console: Avg an array with a Method, as well as overloading methods
* B - Console: Basic linear search using a method. 

## simpleRectangle
* In class exercise in Object / Class creation

## Lab 8
* Create a class called Car that takes a model year and a make, and can show the car accellerating and breaking.
* Console: Create the main class that uses methods to error check for model year and nonempty make string, then accelarates the car 5 times and breaks 5 time.

## Lab 9
* BankAcctDemo.java provided by instructor
* Console: Create the external class CheckAcct that has various Accessors, Mutators, and a static variable that needs its own accessor and mutator.

## Lab 10
* Exception Handling
* Swing Applet to handle commissions and sales using exception handling for error catching.

## Lab 11
* Additional Exception Handling, in Console
* Note, Main() Method and Method names provided by professor (I would have prefered for output not to require any paramaters, and call the functions inside it)

## Lab 12 - Final
* TestMultiply.java - this was a debug assignment. Had to debug and add exception handling. The original code is found in Initial Code to Debug.txt
* FinalATG - A console program that uses the methods getNum1(), getNum2(), that both return non 0 integers, with exception handling, and an Output() method that displays arithmetic functions as done by java.
